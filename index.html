            <p>The first thing I would like to point out is that this is <span>THE BOOK</span> for anyone interested in gender equality.</p>
            <p>This book allows us to understand how systemic the gender gap is. The author provides data and scientific studies to proove this point, also making us realize that even if we know about gender inequlities, the degree is so deep, that we cannot even imagine. </p>
            <p>In my case, it is my Bible. I have read it, and studied it several times</p>
            <p><span>Invisible Women: Exposing data Bias in a World Designeg for Men </span>was published in March 2019 by Chatto & Windus in the UK & Abrams in the US. It is being translated into 30 languages, and is the winner of the 2019 Royal Society Science Book Prize, the 2019 Books Are My Bag Readers Choice Award, and the 2019 Financial Times Business Book of the Year Award. </p>
